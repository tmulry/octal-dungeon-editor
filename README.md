# Checker Dungeon Editor

A point and click pixel art dungeon editor. [https://octal-dungeon-editor.netlify.app/](https://octal-dungeon-editor.netlify.app/)

Initial inspiration for this project came from [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVCrXXfDQcQ&t=2s](JP Coovert's video on Pixel Art Dungeons) and MS Paint.

This editor makes extensive use of the [https://crowbarska.itch.io/eggbit-dungeon-tileset](Eggbit Dungeon Tileset) by Crowbarska. It is a fantastic pixel art tileset and I highly recommend it. If you like using this editor, please consider supporting the creator of the tileset.
